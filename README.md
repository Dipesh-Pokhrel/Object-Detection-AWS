Object Detection with Amazon Sagemaker

Sagemaker includes a number of machine learning algorithms that are ready to use for a variety of tasks. We will use Sagemaker's SSD Object Detection algorithm to create, train, and deploy a model that can localize the faces of dogs and cats in the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.
